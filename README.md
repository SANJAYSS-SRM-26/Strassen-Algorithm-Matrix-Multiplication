# Strassen-Algorithm-Matrix-Multiplication
This repository contains an implementation of Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication in C.

## Code Description

The `strassen_matrix_multiplication.c` file contains the C code to multiply two matrices using Strassen's algorithm. It multiplies two 2x2 matrices as an example and displays the result.

## Time Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication is O(n^log2(7)), which is approximately O(n^2.81). This is an improvement over the traditional matrix multiplication algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n^3).

## Usage

To run the code:
1. Compile the `strassen_matrix_multiplication.c` file using a C compiler.
2. Execute the compiled binary.
